1. Formatting and Structure

Mistake:
Section titles and job positions were merged together (e.g., “Professional ExperienceProject Manager”), making the CV look unstructured.

Fix:
Separated sections clearly and added consistent headers.
✅ Example:

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Project Manager | Innovative Company – New York, USA | Jan 2020 – Present

2. Weak Job Descriptions

Mistake:
The bullet points were vague (e.g., “Managed various projects successfully”).

Fix:
Replaced with strong action verbs and quantifiable results.
✅ Example:

Led 8 cross-functional projects, achieving a 20% reduction in delivery time.

3. Inconsistent Date Format

Mistake:
Different date formats were used (e.g., “2020 - Current” and “May 2018 to Dec 2019”).

Fix:
Standardized all dates to a single format for professional consistency.
✅ Example:

Jan 2020 – Present
May 2018 – Dec 2019

4. Education Section Missing Details

Mistake:
Bachelor’s degree was missing location and graduation date.

Fix:
Added complete and consistent information.
✅ Example:

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
University of Los Angeles, CA | 2012 – 2016

5. Missing Professional Summary

Mistake:
The CV began abruptly with experience details and lacked a personal summary.

Fix:
Added a concise professional summary at the top to highlight key strengths.
✅ Example:

Results-driven Project Manager and Web Developer with over 5 years of experience leading cross-functional teams and delivering software solutions.

✅ Outcome

The corrected CV is now:

Professionally formatted and easy to read

Clear in structure with measurable achievements

Consistent in date and style

Enhanced with a professional summary for better first impressions
